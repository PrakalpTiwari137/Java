# Object oriented approach in Java
## Java OOP concepts
### Inheritance
When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.<br/><br/>
### Polymorphism
If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.<br/><br/>
